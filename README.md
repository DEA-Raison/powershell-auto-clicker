## auto clicking with powershell

There are 3 separate files to help you click through training. click.ps1 is a simple auto clicker for Windows 10 that will click every 0.6 seconds, it will automatically close when the training window is closed; clicker11.ps1 has been updated to work with Windows 11 and will automatically close when you deselect the training window; training-clicker.ps1 is used to click 2 different places until forced to quit. training-clicker.ps1 can be used to click on the status bar then the Next button.

# For people that don't know how to use these:
I chose to rewrite these in powershell because powershell is preinstalled on Windows 10+ systems. You can copy and paste these into Notepad and save as [anything].ps1 to run it, you'll have to right click in the file explorer and Run with Powershell. 
To make it stop, you can close the window or press ctrl+c on that window. 

# Beware that trainging-clicker can be hard to close
